# Quadrotor_failure
A project developed with my colleagues Edoardo Ghini and Gianluca Cerilli. 

The work is based on the paper "Flight control of a Quadrotor Vehicle Subsequent to a Rotor Failure", by Alexander Lanzon, Alessandro Freddi, and Sauro Longhi. 

The controller is based on a double-loop architecture and feedback linearization technique.
